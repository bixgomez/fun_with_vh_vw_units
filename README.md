# Theme: Bixgomez

This is a theme I built to support my PNW Drupal Summit presentation, "Fun (but not too much fun) with vh & vw units".

## Warning

This code is more than a little crazy -- I essentially used twig templates to hard code all of my HTML markup (and content).  There was a method to my madness, however, as my web site became a sort of "living slide deck" for my presentation.

## Context

To view the entire presentation, please enjoy the [session video](https://pnwdrupalsummit.org/2018/sessions/having-fun-not-too-much-fun-vw-and-vh-units).
